ReDead is a team based zombie onslaught gamemode with a number of unique features:


● A dynamic weather system. Thunder, lightning, rain and wind. The weather is randomized each round.

● Random events. They happen over the course of the round. Some are good, like scientists appearing. Some are bad, like temporary radio blackouts. There's even an event which causes a wicked storm using the weather system.

● Intelligent zombie bots that hunt you down. They can also break through doors, breakable walls and windows.

● A bunch of weapons with their own custom base weapon which implements scoping, laser sights, bullet penetration and more. 

● Melee weapons, including a hammer which can be used to build barricades using wood you find.

● An inventory system that is very modular and moddable.

● 4 human classes and 4 zombie classes, each with their own perks.

● Fancy effects. Motion blur, postprocessing, realistic drunkness/infection/etc, blood spatter on your HUD, and more.

● Lots of gore. Blow the torso off of a zombie with a winchester, commit genocides with explosives, instagib zombies with laser weapons and blast the heads off of zombies with pretty much any gun.

● Ailment system. If you are attacked by certain zombies you will start to bleed. If you are hit by most zombies you become infected. You can also become irradiated from certain things.

● Replayability. Never play the same match twice. The antidote spawns randomly around the map throughout the game, and the evacuation helicopter has multiple landing zones.

● Stats. At the end of the round awards are handed out to players who have accomplished great and not-so-great things. If you're one of those fellows who hides in a corner while his teammates do all the work then you will get publicly humiliated. If you do cool things then you'll get a pile of awards.

● ConVars that give the server owner complete control over most gameplay aspects.

● Quite moddable, i've included a bunch of stuff in moddable.lua for people to play around with.

● A custom entity loading system for maps. Do you have a map that doesn't have spawn points on it? You can easily configure the map ingame with hardly any hassle. Any map that has a Nav Mesh is playable.
